##Compilation to war
===================
1. All hibernate or other configuration files need to put on \war\WEB-INF\classes\ and \conf\.
2. If you deploy war on path other than root in Tomcat, you need to specify path name to valuable "application.context" in \conf\application.conf.
3. Run \export-war.bat or "activator war"
