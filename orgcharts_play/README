## Compilation to war
===================
1. All hibernate or other configuration files need to put on \conf\. (Extra files you want to include may put in \war\WEB-INF\classes\)
2. If you deploy war on path other than root in Tomcat, you need to specify path name to valuable "application.context" in \conf\application.conf.
3. If you want to recompile the whole project, you may run clean_compile.bat.
4. Run \export-war.bat or "activator war" and it will do all rest stuff for you :)
5. Run on tomcat 7 or 8, jvm 1.8
